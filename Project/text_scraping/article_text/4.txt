The photographer Mike Escamilla describes himself as a stuntman, professional BMX rider, actor, photographer, filmmaker, director, producer and designer. (He’s also a former X-Games competitor. In 2005 he set world records for the longest back flip and longest 360 on a BMX bike.) And he keeps an itinerary that would exhaust many photojournalists (and make many more envious); since May of this year he has been to Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Puerto Rico, Dominica, Ecuador, Germany, San Francisco and Colorado. When I came across his images on Instagram, it was clear that they were shot by someone with daring and an eye for unusual angles, giving new definition to Robert Capa’s famous advice to photographers: “If your pictures aren’t good enough, you aren’t close enough.”When we decided to commission a photo essay on the new — and somewhat controversial — high-speed yachts that will be sailing in this year’s America’s Cup, Escamilla was perfect for the task. His assignment, while onboard an Oracle Team USA yacht during a practice run, was to capture for readers a visceral sense of what it’s like to ride on what are almost “flying machines,” as Warren St. John puts it in his accompanying text. “Of all the things I’ve done in my life,” Escamilla told St. John, “this was one of the gnarliest.”I called Escamilla to find out more about his other gnarly experiences. Below is a selection of pictures of Escamilla in action — many taken by him — along with snippets from our conversation.
