“The Canyons,” starring Lindsay Lohan, written by Bret Easton Ellis and directed by Paul Schrader, will open today in New York and on video on demand today and in Los Angeles on Aug. 9. This is no small victory for the filmmakers, considering that when the movie was completed, it was unclear whether it would make it to theaters at all. When Stephen Rodrick’s article, “Here Is What Happens When You Cast Lindsay Lohan in Your Movie,” was published in the magazine in mid-January, the film had been rejected by both Sundance and SXSW.Reviews have been mixed, but the volume of press devoted to the film and its star, Lindsay Lohan, who was recently released from a 90-day court-ordered stint in rehab, has reached a peak, with many commentators noting that “The Canyons” has that mix of camp, zeitgeist and notoriety needed to become a cult classic. “People either love it or hate it,” says Stephen Rodrick, who plans to attend the film’s premiere in Los Angeles next week. “But it doesn’t surprise me, the controversy. They knew they were making a film that wasn’t for everybody.”Among those it was made for, perhaps, are fledgling filmmakers. Whatever its critical reception, there’s a good chance that “The Canyons,” made on a $250,000 budget (most of it raised on Kickstarter), will end up being one of the most influential films in decades, showing what can be done outside the increasingly risk-averse studio system.
