\Abstract{Why do some webpages receive massive numbers of pageviews? To determine how content drives viewership, we construct a unique dataset of all articles published by the New York Times (NYT) in August 2013. Our dataset is built from 2 major components, the NYT's internal web traffic data and article content data parsed from the NYT website. We use the internal web traffic data to accurately track the number of page views of each article as well as construct a set of robust control variables such as the desk and section of each article. To build content features, we use various machine learning and statistical natural language processing techniques on our parsed article content data and construct features such as article perplexity, sentiment, reading difficulty, and indicators that denote the presence of pictures, videos, etc. Additionally, we have access to the NYT's internal website traffic data. We feed all of our constructed features to into a predictive regression model. We find [MAJOR RESULTS HERE].}

\section{Introduction} % The \section*{} command stops section numbering

In today's digital economy, many companies are very interested in attracting users to visit their websites in order to earn ad revenue. While many factors might motivate a user to visit a particular page, certainly one important factor is the content in that webpage. This paper explores the relationship between the content of a webpage and the number of page views it ultimately ends up receiving by constructing a unique dataset of all articles published by the New York Times (NYT) during August 2013. This dataset is built from two major components: the NYT's internal web traffic data and parsed NYT article content data.

Typically, a study such as ours tends to be very difficult to conduct as either accurate measures of viewership are unavailable\footnote{While oftentimes precise viewership data tends to be not available openly, oftentimes researchers use related observables, such as Facebook likes} or the feature extraction of the content is too challenging (for example Youtube), or or both. Fortunately, our access to the the NYT's internal web traffic data allows us to exactly measure the number of page views an article receives. The web traffic data is rather rich and also includes internal meta-data that we use to build various control features. Moreover, since we are working with mostly textual data, we are able to take advantage of recent advancements in machine learning and statistical NLP to do feature extraction on article text. 

A similar study by Berger and Milkman (2012) \cite{BergerMilkman12} examines the relationship between content and word-of-mouth virality. They find that the emotional content of a NYT article is predictive of its virality. Using simple measures of an article's sentiment and emotionality, Berger and Milkman show that positive articles are more likely to show up on the New York Times "Most-Emailed" list. They also show that articles that evoke high physiological positive or negative arousal (such as awe or anger) tend to be more viral than articles that evoke deactivating emotions (sadness). We build on this study in two ways: first, we relate an article's content back to the number of page views it receives rather than its virality\footnote{Which companies arguably care more about since word-of-mouth virality is usually a means to increase page views}. Second, we employ more sophisticated machine learning feature extraction techniques to see if they work any better over their simple measures.

\section{Data}
\subsection{NYT Internal Web Traffic Data}
Our NYT internal web traffic dataset is a record of all individual user activity on the NYT website covering the period of April 3rd, 2013 to October 31st, 2013. This activity data is stored as individual lines of json and includes who (if available) accessed what page at what time. Overall, it is over 20 terabytes in size and contains over 3 billion page views\footnote{Not all page views are article views, for example, some events that are also tracked are searches, or user account settings.} Since the scope of this dataset is so large, we initially restrict this project to a single month, August 2013. 

Looking at only pages that only contain articles or blogposts,
